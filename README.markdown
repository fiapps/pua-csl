This is a [CSL][] citation style based on the _Norme Metodologiche_
of the [Pontifical University Antonianum][PUA]. The specific version
I try to follow was approved by the Academic Senate of the University
May 22, 2002. I use this style with [Zotero][] for academic work. It
is a work in progress, and I make no guarantee that it conforms to
the Norme or will produce citations acceptable to PUA professors.

The starting point for this stylesheet was one for the Chicago Manual
of Style. Thus, aspects of citations which are unspecified by the
_Norme Metodologiche_ will resemble CMS citations. This is especially
true for types of citations unforeseen by the Norme, such as citations
of films, legal cases, etc.
